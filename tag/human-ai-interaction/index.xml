      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Workshop on Communication in Human-AI Interaction will be held in MalmÃ¶, Sweden on June 10. The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together experts from AI, HCI, and Cognitive Sciences to explore and understand the specificities and characteristics of communication in human-AI interactions, as well as the salient principles, methods, and theories one has to consider to build meaningful human-AI communication systems. As the study of communication in human-AI interaction is by essence a multidisciplinary approach, we aim for this workshop to be a multidisciplinary platform where researchers can learn to work together and pave the way to impacting research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look at our &lt;a href=&#34;https://chai-workshop.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. and consider submitting a paper!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2022, we hosted the first workshop on Communication in Human-AI Interaction (CHAI) at the 31st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2022). The goal of this one-day workshop was to bring together experts from AI, HCI, and Cognitive Sciences to explore and understand the specificities and characteristics of communication in human-AI interactions, as well as the salient principles, methods, and theories one has to consider to build meaningful human-AI communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We attended 8 paper presentations, as well as two very inspiring keynotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicolas Fay&lt;/strong&gt;, Associate Professor of Cognitive Sciences, presented to us the Role of Iconicity and Embodiment to the Evolution of Human Communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Riedl&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor in Artificial Intelligence, argumed for Automated Story Generation as a Lens for Fundamental Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were very glad to have a very good attendance and fantastic discussions. Thanks to the organizing team, the PC members, and all the participants for making this event a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link to the accepted papers and the slides of our keynotes are available on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://chai-workshop.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;workshop website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned, for a 2023 edition might be coming! ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;
