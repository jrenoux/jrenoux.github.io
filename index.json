In this talk, I started with a short introduction to what AI is in order to give the audience (non-specialists) an idea of what we are actually working on when we talk about AI. I then provided some information about ethical issues related to AI (we could only scratch the surface!), and went on to discuss who is currently talking on the world stage and what their narrative was. I advocated for a change of narrative and a more inclusive discussion around AI. Currently, the general public is absent from the discussion about AI and its future, even though it is directly impacted. I believe (and argued) that AI must become a political question the same way economy, social welfare, or ecology are political questions.

This time about how we communicate with robots. The article in Swedish is available here. In this page is the English version ! Enjoy ! How do you know how to communicate? Communication is universal and innate. We were all born with the ability to communicate, and all humans do communicate. Animals communicate. Even plants communicate. We also see inter-species communication. We communicate with animals. But communication is also cultural and socially constructed. We do not communicate the same way in Sweden, in Japan, or in South Africa. We do not communicate the same way if we come from a rich or poor background. We do not communicate the same way at 10, 40, or 65 years old. And teenagers today certainly do not communicate the same way teenagers communicated 40 years ago.\nSo what happens when our communication partner is not a human or an animal anymore, as it has been for millennia, but a robot? Robots, and more generally Artificial Intelligence, are strange entities. They are obviously not alive, but they are programmed to show some form of agency. So how do we communicate with an AI? As a researcher in Human-AI communication, this question is the core of my research interests.\nWhen we communicate with an AI, we will naturally employ some of the communication habits and constructs that we have learned during our previous interactions with humans and animals to guide us. We will try to make sense of this unknown partner through previous experiences. To do this, we will get influenced by how the AI looks and behave. If it looks childish, or cartoonish, we may talk to it as we would talk to a child. We will communicate to animal-resembling robots like we would with a pet. We will say “please” and “thank you” to ChatGPT. And while research has shown that drawing from these previous experiences might in fact help human-AI communication, it has also shown that we are not communicating exactly the same way with AI than we do with humans. For instance, a study in 2017 investigated how people interacted with an AI chatbot on a well-known social media compared to interactions with other humans. They figured out that humans employed different strategies when communicating with the AI than with the humans.\nHow the AI system is programmed also has a strong impact on how a user will communicate with it. The persona displayed by an AI influences what characteristics we attribute to it. Does it present more male or female, is it friendly, assertive, arrogant? Is it more robotic or more human-like? And these decisions are entirely controlled by the people who develop these systems. An AI does not have the experience of a human being to draw from. It is a blank sheet on which a team of researchers and developers decide to write their ideas and values. And currently, the big push in the research community is to make communicative AI as human-like and “natural” as possible to facilitate communication. Researchers and engineers develop systems that communicate using language, that can show emotions and social cues in a natural way, all of this to make the interaction as natural as possible. But natural for whom?\nHave you ever heard of the W.E.I.R.D. acronym? It stands for “Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic.” It has been coined by the American anthropologist Joseph Heinrich and his collaborators, and is used as way to summarize the background of most participants in psychological research, and by extension in Human-AI Interaction research. Most participants (and in fact, researchers) in these fields come from countries in the “West” (Western Europe or North America), with a high level of education, that are highly industrialized, globally rich, and generally democratic. His research has also shown that there are a lot of psychological differences between populations around the world and that W.E.I.R.D. populations are quite peculiar in their psychology. Therefore, the results drawn from research on these participants are not necessarily applicable to the population in all its diversity.\nThis diversity issue also holds for other aspects of people’ life, and to the W.E.I.R.D. classification, I would also like to add “Able-bodied,” “Neurotypical,” and “English-speaking.” Research and development often fails to account for people with disabilities or neurodivergent, except when developing systems to “help” them. But on the contrary, systems most often end up exclusionary. Recent work has examined the guidelines that constructors were implementing in voice activated personal assistants (like Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Echo…). And they figured out that these guidelines are actively making usability worse for blind and visually impaired users. Blind and visually impaired users benefit greatly from voice assistants for every day tasks. But they also are able to process much faster speech and much more complex spoken sentences than sighted users.

It remains a scientific challenge to understand which external incentives enable cooperation and whether that can be facilitated through socially interactive agents. In this paper, we evaluate human cooperation in the presence of an artificial virtual agent. We developed a game called The Pest Control, in which five players attempt to maxi- mize their earnings while avoiding being infested by a spreading pest. Controlling the pest requires costly public good contributions, yet free-riding on the efforts of others leads to maximum individ- ual payoffs. We conducted an online experiment and analyzed the data of 265 participants, where we manipulated the feedback strat- egy of the virtual agent in a between-subject design. Our results suggest that feedback highlighting salient elements of the game increases participants’ cooperation, while feedback regarding the consequences of actions slightly promotes selfish behaviors. Our study provides insight into how future artificial agents and AI sys- tems could be designed to promote cooperation in complex social dilemmas by leveraging different strategies.","tags":["human-AI communication","prosociality"],"title":"The Effect of Agent-Based Feedback on Prosociality in Social Dilemmas","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Popular Science"],"content":"Note : two versions of this article have been created and published, one in Swedish published in Nerikes Allehanda, and one in Frence published in Le Club Mediapart. Note that this post is not an exact translation of these two articles but the original English version. The final articles have been shortened to fit the other newspapers format.\n–\nWe are being influenced by non-human entities that imitate humans, infiltrate human society, working on behalf of unknown organizations. Our opinions, our actions, our lives are being influenced by these entities. They are everywhere, in our home, at work, in our hospitals. This is not the plot of a new Hollywood movie, nor some conspiratory rambling about a secret alien society. This is our world since the popularization of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nEven though the entire world started to talk about Artificial Intelligence a bit more than 2 years ago with the release of ChatGPT, AI has been with us for much longer than that. AI systems have been introduced in our lives with or without our knowledge and consent. Netflix or Spotify’s recommendation algorithms, who suggests you the next movie to watch or a nice playlist to listen to, are everyday examples. But more algorithms are impacting our lives than we think. Did you know that your mortgage request might have been granted by an AI system? Or that your resume might have been rejected by an AI? Or that the photo that stirred your emotion on the news outlet you read yesterday was AI generated?\nWe are being exposed to AI, whether we want it or not. And AI is not neutral. People create or use an AI system to solve a problem. This could be too many mortgage requests or resumes to go through for one person, the difficulty to find the right photo to reflect the tone of the article or even the intention to manipulate the reader’s emotion. But how the system actually ends up working depends on a social context : what the solution is supposed to look like, the data that is used to create this solution, the values that the system’s creator wants to uphold. And creators don’t always anticipate all the consequences of their choices.\nAlgorithmic bias is the concept that an algorithm systematically creates unfair outcomes, privileging one group of people over another, usually in ways that are not the intended function of the algorithm. Common examples are Amazon’s recruiting tool that discriminated against women, facial recognition algorithms that do not differentiate between different black persons, or medical systems that underestimate the medical needs of minorities. Algorithmic bias can have multiple causes. Often people will attribute this to data : if the data is biased, the system will be too. While this is true, it would be a mistake to think that data is the only culprit. For instance, in the United State, hospitals have been using an AI system to help them decide whether an incoming patient should be sent to the emergency room or not based on their medical history. Understanding the medical history of a patient is a very complex problem, and the developers of the algorithm made the assumption that people with a severe medical history will spend more money on healthcare than others. They therefore used the amount of money previously spent on healthcare as a substitute for medical history. However, due to socio-economical reasons, black Americans spend on average less money on healthcare than white Americans with similar needs. Therefore, the algorithm systematically underestimated black American’s medical needs. Data itself is not the issue here. It is important to note that algorithmic biases go much further than sexist or racist biases. For instance, researchers have been studying linguistic biases in ChatGPT and demonstrated that it is stereotyping dialects, which made users of these dialects feel uncomfortable and insulted. Cultural biases or misrepresentations are other issues associated to AI systems.\nWhy does it matter? After all, if we know these systems are biased, can’t we check the output ourselves and make our own mind? Unfortunately, it is not that simple. We all have a tendency to favor decisions made with automation compared to decision made without. This is called automation bias, and is well studied in psychology. This means that when AI systems present us with a solution, we are naturally inclined to adopt this solution. Yes, this applies even if you are aware that automation bias is a thing. Furthermore, researchers have also shown that using AI systems directly impacts our opinions. In a study, a language model was programmed to promote a specific opinion towards social media. Participants who used this model wrote pieces that followed the promoted opinion, and even had their own stance towards social media influenced by the model. This is a frightening find. More and more text is being written with the help of ChatGPT and other AI assistants, and we have no control over the opinions programmed in …","date":1744329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1744329600,"objectID":"24fe1f5e26369b7245f397510552ba2e","permalink":"https://jrenoux.github.io/popular-science/ai-is-political-issue/","publishdate":"2025-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/popular-science/ai-is-political-issue/","section":"popular-science","summary":"Note : two versions of this article have been created and published, one in Swedish published in Nerikes Allehanda, and one in Frence published in Le Club Mediapart.

We investigate how state-of-the-art models perform in recognizing nouns and modifiers from images, and propose our method by introducing a dataset and CLIP-like recognition techniques based on transfer learning and metric learning. We show real-world experiments that demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to robotics applications.

The agent receives information about its environment (state or observation) and uses it as a way to optimize a state-based reward function. Recent works, however, have focused on application domains in which information gathering is not only the mean but the goal itself. The agent must optimize its knowledge of the environment. However, traditional Markov-based decision-theoretic models cannot account for rewarding the agent based on its knowledge, which leads to the development of many approaches to overcome this limitation. We survey recent approaches for using decision-theoretic models in information-gathering scenarios, highlighting common practices and existing generic models and show that existing methods can be categorized into three classes: reactive sensing, single-agent active sensing, and multi-agent active sensing. Finally, we highlight potential research gaps and suggest directions for future research.","tags":["information gathering","active sensing","decision-theoretic planning"],"title":"From Reactive to Active Sensing: A Survey on Information Gathering in Decision-Theoretic Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Renoux"],"categories":["Papers"],"content":"Our new paper titled “From Reactive to Active Sensing: a Survey on Information Gathering in Decision-Theoretic Planning” has ben accepted for publication in ACM Computing Survey.\nIn this paper, we looked at how previous work tackled the problem of information gathering in MDP-based system. Indeed, in most cases, information gathering is simply a mean to a goal. When it becomes the goal, such as in search and rescue or surveillance scenarios, traditional decision-theoretic systems cannot model the problem effectively. Many researchers have searched ways to circumvent this problem. We distinguished two different approaches:\n Reactive Sensing : where the model makes use of “external stimuli” to “trick” the agent to gather information. This approach is often very application-dependent, and does not allow to reason on the lack of informtaion as information in itself. Active Sensing : where the model actually incorporates reasoning about information states. This approach has the advantage to explicety reason about information gain (and the lack of thereof) but at the cost of complexity. We also observed that it is in fact very seldom applied to real-life scenarios.

You have never worked with these machines before. For your first task, you must extract fuel samples from multiple trucks and use the machine’s sensors to analyze them for predictive maintenance. The first machine will only give you information about the task if you ask for it. You are at high risk of missing important information if you don’t know the right question to ask, such as the fact that you should only collect samples on trucks that have not been used for at least an hour.\nThe second machine will give you information proactively, but can only explain how the entire task should be carried out, from the beginning and regardless of what you can and cannot perform. It will always instruct you to select a truck that has been unused for at least an hour, then collect the sample with the dedicated device, then place the sample on the machine’s analyzer, then turn on the robot’s analyzing program, etc. While this information makes sense the first time you interact with the machine, it becomes quickly irrelevant and cumbersome in the long term.\nThe third machine has been tailored to your needs: your preferences, your level of expertise, your skills, your abilities and will give you precisely the right amount and type of information. However, if you happen to leave the company or miss some days of work, no one will be able to use this machine until it is reconfigured, which is a costly and cumbersome operation.\nIt seems obvious that none of these three machines constitute the ideal partner for a collaborative task in a multi-user environment. This, however, is the current state of the art in human-machine communication. In this project, we propose to realize intelligent agents that combine all three machine’s communication skills.\nOur vision with this project is to advance the field of collaborative Artificial Intelligence, i.e., the development of artificially intelligent agents that can interact with humans, leveraging their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. Adaptive purposeful communication planning, i.e., the ability to plan communication actions to a given goal and adapt them to changing contexts and users, is a crucial component for collaborative AI and the central topic of this project.\nIf this sounds interesting to you, stay tuned as we will soon start the recruitment of a Ph.D. student!\n","date":1667902920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667902920,"objectID":"1837e175a60897d310f5380e591b7a83","permalink":"https://jrenoux.github.io/talks-events/vr-2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-08T10:22:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks-events/vr-2022/","section":"talks-events","summary":"My proposal, titled \"Communication Planning for Collaborative AI\" has been accepted by the Swedish national research council (Vetenskaprådet)","tags":["Communication Planning","Research Project"],"title":"VR Project Grant Accepted","type":"talks-events"},{"authors":["Jennifer Renoux"],"categories":["Invited Talks"],"content":"On Sept. 6, 2022, I had the pleasure of presenting an Introduction to AI Ethics and Engineer at one of Swedsoft Seminars.
