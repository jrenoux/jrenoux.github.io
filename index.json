It remains a scientific challenge to understand which external incentives enable cooperation and whether that can be facilitated through socially interactive agents. In this paper, we evaluate human cooperation in the presence of an artificial virtual agent. We developed a game called The Pest Control, in which five players attempt to maxi- mize their earnings while avoiding being infested by a spreading pest. Controlling the pest requires costly public good contributions, yet free-riding on the efforts of others leads to maximum individ- ual payoffs. We conducted an online experiment and analyzed the data of 265 participants, where we manipulated the feedback strat- egy of the virtual agent in a between-subject design. Our results suggest that feedback highlighting salient elements of the game increases participants’ cooperation, while feedback regarding the consequences of actions slightly promotes selfish behaviors. Our study provides insight into how future artificial agents and AI sys- tems could be designed to promote cooperation in complex social dilemmas by leveraging different strategies.","tags":["human-AI communication","prosociality"],"title":"The Effect of Agent-Based Feedback on Prosociality in Social Dilemmas","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Note : two versions of this article have been created and published, one in Swedish published in Nerikes Allehanda, and one in Frence published in Le Club Mediapart. Note that this post is not an exact translation of these two articles but the original English version. The final articles have been shortened to fit the other newspapers format.\n–\nWe are being influenced by non-human entities that imitate humans, infiltrate human society, working on behalf of unknown organizations. Our opinions, our actions, our lives are being influenced by these entities. They are everywhere, in our home, at work, in our hospitals. This is not the plot of a new Hollywood movie, nor some conspiratory rambling about a secret alien society. This is our world since the popularization of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nEven though the entire world started to talk about Artificial Intelligence a bit more than 2 years ago with the release of ChatGPT, AI has been with us for much longer than that. AI systems have been introduced in our lives with or without our knowledge and consent. Netflix or Spotify’s recommendation algorithms, who suggests you the next movie to watch or a nice playlist to listen to, are everyday examples. But more algorithms are impacting our lives than we think. Did you know that your mortgage request might have been granted by an AI system? Or that your resume might have been rejected by an AI? Or that the photo that stirred your emotion on the news outlet you read yesterday was AI generated?\nWe are being exposed to AI, whether we want it or not. And AI is not neutral. People create or use an AI system to solve a problem. This could be too many mortgage requests or resumes to go through for one person, the difficulty to find the right photo to reflect the tone of the article or even the intention to manipulate the reader’s emotion. But how the system actually ends up working depends on a social context : what the solution is supposed to look like, the data that is used to create this solution, the values that the system’s creator wants to uphold. And creators don’t always anticipate all the consequences of their choices.\nAlgorithmic bias is the concept that an algorithm systematically creates unfair outcomes, privileging one group of people over another, usually in ways that are not the intended function of the algorithm. Common examples are Amazon’s recruiting tool that discriminated against women, facial recognition algorithms that do not differentiate between different black persons, or medical systems that underestimate the medical needs of minorities. Algorithmic bias can have multiple causes. Often people will attribute this to data : if the data is biased, the system will be too. While this is true, it would be a mistake to think that data is the only culprit. For instance, in the United State, hospitals have been using an AI system to help them decide whether an incoming patient should be sent to the emergency room or not based on their medical history. Understanding the medical history of a patient is a very complex problem, and the developers of the algorithm made the assumption that people with a severe medical history will spend more money on healthcare than others. They therefore used the amount of money previously spent on healthcare as a substitute for medical history. However, due to socio-economical reasons, black Americans spend on average less money on healthcare than white Americans with similar needs. Therefore, the algorithm systematically underestimated black American’s medical needs. Data itself is not the issue here. It is important to note that algorithmic biases go much further than sexist or racist biases. For instance, researchers have been studying linguistic biases in ChatGPT and demonstrated that it is stereotyping dialects, which made users of these dialects feel uncomfortable and insulted. Cultural biases or misrepresentations are other issues associated to AI systems.\nWhy does it matter? After all, if we know these systems are biased, can’t we check the output ourselves and make our own mind? Unfortunately, it is not that simple. We all have a tendency to favor decisions made with automation compared to decision made without. This is called automation bias, and is well studied in psychology. This means that when AI systems present us with a solution, we are naturally inclined to adopt this solution. Yes, this applies even if you are aware that automation bias is a thing. Furthermore, researchers have also shown that using AI systems directly impacts our opinions. In a study, a language model was programmed to promote a specific opinion towards social media. Participants who used this model wrote pieces that followed the promoted opinion, and even had their own stance towards social media influenced by the model. This is a frightening find. More and more text is being written with the help of ChatGPT and other AI assistants, and we have no control over the opinions programmed in …","date":1744329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1744329600,"objectID":"24fe1f5e26369b7245f397510552ba2e","permalink":"https://jrenoux.github.io/popular-science/ai-is-political-issue/","publishdate":"2025-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/popular-science/ai-is-political-issue/","section":"popular-science","summary":"Note : two versions of this article have been created and published, one in Swedish published in Nerikes Allehanda, and one in Frence published in Le Club Mediapart.

Existing works either encode the image or the language into a subsymbolic space, like the CLIP model, or create a symbolic space of extracted information, like the object detection models. In this paper, we propose to describe images by nouns and modifiers and introduce a new embedded binding space where the linguistic and visual cues can effectively be bound. We investigate how state-of-the-art models perform in recognizing nouns and modifiers from images, and propose our method by introducing a dataset and CLIP-like recognition techniques based on transfer learning and metric learning. We show real-world experiments that demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to robotics applications. Our results indicate that our method can surpass the state-of-the-art in recognizing nouns and modifiers from images.

Nevertheless, human-AI Interaction researchers rarely engage with these criticism nor with the methodological approaches usually highlighted in Critical Disability Studies and Critical Autism Studies. This result in the development of Social Robots that focus on corrective actions for autism instead of empowering actions.

The agent receives information about its environment (state or observation) and uses it as a way to optimize a state-based reward function. Recent works, however, have focused on application domains in which information gathering is not only the mean but the goal itself. The agent must optimize its knowledge of the environment. However, traditional Markov-based decision-theoretic models cannot account for rewarding the agent based on its knowledge, which leads to the development of many approaches to overcome this limitation. We survey recent approaches for using decision-theoretic models in information-gathering scenarios, highlighting common practices and existing generic models and show that existing methods can be categorized into three classes: reactive sensing, single-agent active sensing, and multi-agent active sensing. Finally, we highlight potential research gaps and suggest directions for future research.","tags":["information gathering","active sensing","decision-theoretic planning"],"title":"From Reactive to Active Sensing: A Survey on Information Gathering in Decision-Theoretic Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Renoux"],"categories":["Papers"],"content":"Our new paper titled “From Reactive to Active Sensing: a Survey on Information Gathering in Decision-Theoretic Planning” has ben accepted for publication in ACM Computing Survey.\nIn this paper, we looked at how previous work tackled the problem of information gathering in MDP-based system. Indeed, in most cases, information gathering is simply a mean to a goal. When it becomes the goal, such as in search and rescue or surveillance scenarios, traditional decision-theoretic systems cannot model the problem effectively. Many researchers have searched ways to circumvent this problem. We distinguished two different approaches:\n Reactive Sensing : where the model makes use of “external stimuli” to “trick” the agent to gather information. This approach is often very application-dependent, and does not allow to reason on the lack of informtaion as information in itself. Active Sensing : where the model actually incorporates reasoning about information states. This approach has the advantage to explicety reason about information gain (and the lack of thereof) but at the cost of complexity. We also observed that it is in fact very seldom applied to real-life scenarios.

You have never worked with these machines before. For your first task, you must extract fuel samples from multiple trucks and use the machine’s sensors to analyze them for predictive maintenance. The first machine will only give you information about the task if you ask for it. You are at high risk of missing important information if you don’t know the right question to ask, such as the fact that you should only collect samples on trucks that have not been used for at least an hour.\nThe second machine will give you information proactively, but can only explain how the entire task should be carried out, from the beginning and regardless of what you can and cannot perform. It will always instruct you to select a truck that has been unused for at least an hour, then collect the sample with the dedicated device, then place the sample on the machine’s analyzer, then turn on the robot’s analyzing program, etc. While this information makes sense the first time you interact with the machine, it becomes quickly irrelevant and cumbersome in the long term.\nThe third machine has been tailored to your needs: your preferences, your level of expertise, your skills, your abilities and will give you precisely the right amount and type of information. However, if you happen to leave the company or miss some days of work, no one will be able to use this machine until it is reconfigured, which is a costly and cumbersome operation.\nIt seems obvious that none of these three machines constitute the ideal partner for a collaborative task in a multi-user environment. This, however, is the current state of the art in human-machine communication. In this project, we propose to realize intelligent agents that combine all three machine’s communication skills.\nOur vision with this project is to advance the field of collaborative Artificial Intelligence, i.e., the development of artificially intelligent agents that can interact with humans, leveraging their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. Adaptive purposeful communication planning, i.e., the ability to plan communication actions to a given goal and adapt them to changing contexts and users, is a crucial component for collaborative AI and the central topic of this project.\nIf this sounds interesting to you, stay tuned as we will soon start the recruitment of a Ph.D. student!\n","date":1667902920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667902920,"objectID":"1837e175a60897d310f5380e591b7a83","permalink":"https://jrenoux.github.io/talks-events/vr-2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-08T10:22:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks-events/vr-2022/","section":"talks-events","summary":"My proposal, titled \"Communication Planning for Collaborative AI\" has been accepted by the Swedish national research council (Vetenskaprådet)","tags":["Communication Planning","Research Project"],"title":"VR Project Grant Accepted","type":"talks-events"},{"authors":["Jennifer Renoux"],"categories":["Invited Talks"],"content":"On Sept. 6, 2022, I had the pleasure of presenting an Introduction to AI Ethics and Engineer at one of Swedsoft Seminars.
