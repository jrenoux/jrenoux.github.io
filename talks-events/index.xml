      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Workshop on Communication in Human-AI Interaction will be held in Malmö, Sweden on June 10. The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together experts from AI, HCI, and Cognitive Sciences to explore and understand the specificities and characteristics of communication in human-AI interactions, as well as the salient principles, methods, and theories one has to consider to build meaningful human-AI communication systems. As the study of communication in human-AI interaction is by essence a multidisciplinary approach, we aim for this workshop to be a multidisciplinary platform where researchers can learn to work together and pave the way to impacting research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look at our &lt;a href=&#34;https://chai-workshop.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. and consider submitting a paper!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our new extended abstract titled &amp;ldquo;From Corrective to Empowering Technologies: Integrating Critical Perspectives in Social Robotics for Autism&amp;rdquo; has been accepted for presentation at the Inter.HAI workshop! In this paper, we look at how the social robotics field usually look at autism as a problem that needs to be corrected, and introduce two approaches that are of interest for social robotics researchers who want to adopt a more critical approach. You can access the paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://jrenoux.github.io/uploads/papers/interhai-2023-cei-jrx.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paper accepted ! &#34;From Reactive to Active Sensing: a Survey on Information Gathering in Decision-Theoretic Planning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our new paper titled &amp;ldquo;From Reactive to Active Sensing: a Survey on Information Gathering in Decision-Theoretic Planning&amp;rdquo; has ben accepted for publication in ACM Computing Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we looked at how previous work tackled the problem of information gathering in MDP-based system. Indeed, in most cases, information gathering is simply a mean to a goal. When it becomes the goal, such as in search and rescue or surveillance scenarios, traditional decision-theoretic systems cannot model the problem effectively. Many researchers have searched ways to circumvent this problem. We distinguished two different approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reactive Sensing : where the model makes use of &amp;ldquo;external stimuli&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo; the agent to gather information. This approach is often very application-dependent, and does not allow to reason on the lack of informtaion as information in itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active Sensing : where the model actually incorporates reasoning about information states. This approach has the advantage to explicety reason about information gain (and the lack of thereof) but at the cost of complexity. We also observed that it is in fact very seldom applied to real-life scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this read will interest you and do not hesitate to get in touch if you want to chat about this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VR Project Grant Accepted</title>
      <link>https://jrenoux.github.io/talks-events/vr-2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 10:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jrenoux.github.io/talks-events/vr-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project proposal I&amp;rsquo;m leading, titled &amp;ldquo;Adaptive Communication Planning for Collaborative AI&amp;rdquo;, has been funded by the Swedish National Research Council (Vetenskaprådet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this project&amp;rsquo;s scope, imagine that you are newly employed in a company that uses three types of intelligent machines to assist workers in their various tasks. You have never worked with these machines before. For your first task, you must extract fuel samples from multiple trucks and use the machine’s sensors to analyze them for predictive maintenance. The first machine will only give you information about the task if you ask for it. You are at high risk of missing important information if you don’t know the right question to ask, such as the fact that you should only collect samples on trucks that have not been used for at least an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second machine will give you information proactively, but can only explain how the entire task should be carried out, from the beginning and regardless of what you can and cannot perform. It will always instruct you to select a truck that has been unused for at least an hour, then collect the sample with the dedicated device, then place the sample on the machine’s analyzer, then turn on the robot’s analyzing program, etc. While this information makes sense the first time you interact with the machine, it becomes quickly irrelevant and cumbersome in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third machine has been tailored to your needs: your preferences, your level of expertise, your skills, your abilities and will give you precisely the right amount and type of information. However, if you happen to leave the company or miss some days of work, no one will be able to use this machine until it is reconfigured, which is a costly and cumbersome operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious that none of these three machines constitute the ideal partner for a collaborative task in a multi-user environment. This, however, is the current state of the art in
human-machine communication. In this project, we propose to realize intelligent agents that combine all three machine&amp;rsquo;s communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vision with this project is to advance the field of collaborative Artificial Intelligence, i.e., the development of artificially intelligent agents that can interact with humans, leveraging their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses.  Adaptive purposeful communication planning, i.e., the ability to plan communication actions to a given goal and adapt them to changing contexts and users, is a crucial component for collaborative AI and the central topic of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds interesting to you, stay tuned as we will soon start the recruitment of a Ph.D. student!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 25, 2022, we hosted the Cultu-ro workshsop at Ro-MAN 2022. The workshop will focused on the cultural influences in human-robot interaction. Robots have the potential to improve services in areas such as eldercare, rehabilitation, training, and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information and detail of the program available &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/culturo-roman22/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on the workshop website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jrenoux.github.io/talks-events/chai-ijcai/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2022, we hosted the first workshop on Communication in Human-AI Interaction (CHAI) at the 31st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2022). The goal of this one-day workshop was to bring together experts from AI, HCI, and Cognitive Sciences to explore and understand the specificities and characteristics of communication in human-AI interactions, as well as the salient principles, methods, and theories one has to consider to build meaningful human-AI communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We attended 8 paper presentations, as well as two very inspiring keynotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicolas Fay&lt;/strong&gt;, Associate Professor of Cognitive Sciences, presented to us the Role of Iconicity and Embodiment to the Evolution of Human Communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Riedl&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor in Artificial Intelligence, argumed for Automated Story Generation as a Lens for Fundamental Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were very glad to have a very good attendance and fantastic discussions. Thanks to the organizing team, the PC members, and all the participants for making this event a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link to the accepted papers and the slides of our keynotes are available on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://chai-workshop.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;workshop website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned, for a 2023 edition might be coming! 😉&lt;/p&gt;
